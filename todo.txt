- frame rule
- using of contruct \at in assertions
- value in location can be location (pointer)
- a map of variables (var -> nat) : in term of separartion logic, we have for the moment only a hear (nat -> nat) and we can add a stack (var -> nat) for modeling the behavior of
  a memory allocator for global variables (require to be separated in the case of relational properties) thus canot be the same as in WP there the stack in hard coded.
